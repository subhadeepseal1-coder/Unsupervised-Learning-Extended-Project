# Unsupervised-Learning-Extended-Project
OnSports
Course: Unsupervised Learning
This project aims to optimize player valuation for OnSports' fantasy football platform. By conducting a cluster analysis on player performance data, we will identify distinct player segments based on their potential and past performance. This will enable OnSports to set accurate player prices for the upcoming season, ensuring fair competition and attracting a wider user base.

Skills & Tools Covered:
Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Scaling
Clustering
K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Silhouette Score
Cophenetic Correlation
Dimensionality Reduction
Cluster Profiling
My Learnings:
üìä 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted detailed analysis of player performance data, including metrics like goals, assists, passes, and minutes played. Identified patterns, trends, and potential outliers among player attributes that influence fantasy value. ‚öñÔ∏è 2. Data Preprocessing & Scaling: Learned to scale numerical features using techniques like StandardScaler to ensure uniformity in clustering. Understood the importance of preprocessing for distance-based algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. üß† 3. Clustering Techniques: Applied K-Means Clustering to segment players into distinct groups based on performance and potential. Implemented Hierarchical Clustering and visualized clusters using dendrograms to discover relationships. Understood how to determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. üîç 4. Cluster Evaluation & Validation: Used Silhouette Score to evaluate cluster compactness and separation. Applied Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient to validate the quality of hierarchical clusters. üß© 5. Dimensionality Reduction & Visualization: Applied PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce feature space and visualize clusters in 2D or 3D space without losing critical variance. üë• 6. Cluster Profiling & Business Insights: Interpreted clusters to create player profiles such as: Star performers Value-for-money picks Underperformers or risky picks Provided strategic recommendations for player pricing, aimed at balancing fairness, engagement, and competition. üí° Overall Takeaway: Learned to apply unsupervised learning and clustering techniques to segment high-dimensional sports data. This project enhanced my ability to create data-driven player valuations, enabling better platform design, fair pricing, and a richer user experience for fantasy football players.
